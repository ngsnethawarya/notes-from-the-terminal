# Notes from the Terminal

This repo is a place for quick notes, reminders, and thoughts
that come up while working in the terminal.

Not documentation.
Not a tutorial.
Just raw notes from learning and experimenting.

Some days it’s one line.
Some days it’s more.

Learning happens one command at a time.
